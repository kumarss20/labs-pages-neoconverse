Neoconverse is an application to demonstrate natural language database search with GenAI.
It makes existing graph databases available to non-technical users, allowing them to issue natural language questions.
Using the graph database schema, question-statement examples, and fine-tuning, the natural language question is translated by an LLM to a graph query (Cypher). 
Which is then validated and executed against the database.

The query results are sent with the user question to the LLM to generate a natural language answer.
Alterantively the LLM can be configured to generate the data an configuration to render the results of the query as a chart for visual representation.

== Functionality Includes

* Interact with neo4j knowledge graph in natural language
* Ability to add your own neo4j databases as agents and interact in plain english 
* Ability to add your own LLM model from cloud providers (GCP and Open AI currently supported, AWS Bedrock coming soon)
* Generate chart visualizations
// * extract entities?

== How it works

1. First, the user enters a question in natural language format.
2. This question is then converted into cypher queries using an LLM (Large Language Model).
3. The cypher queries are executed in a configured Neo4j database.
4. The results are returned in JSON format.
5. The JSON results from the grounded Neo4j database are then converted into a more readable format using the configured LLM.
